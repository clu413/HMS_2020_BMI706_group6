#### Combining data

By combining the two data sets, one could derive the following information:

- How timing of school closures affected the rate of new cases overall and by state  
- Comparing 'R0' or the positive case rate before and after an intervention policy like school closures is enacted
- The 'incubation time' between an intervention policy like school closures and when there is an effect in  the number of cases or hospitalizations  
- How states' testing capacity correlated with school closure policies

Our goal is to explore whether school closures demonstrate direct impact on the rate of new cases.

```{r}
## remove NAs in school closure data - removed Bureau of Indian Education 
school_closure_data <- na.omit(school_closure_data, cols="StateClosureStartDate")

## match up states - removed Department of Defense Education Activity
school_closure_data <- school_closure_data[school_closure_data$StateAbbreviation %in% unique(dat$state), ]

# reformat dates for merging
dat$date <- as.Date(dat$date,
  format = "%Y%m%d")
# merge two datasets by state
dat <- merge(dat,school_closure_data[c('StateAbbreviation','StateClosureStartDate')], by.x="state", by.y="StateAbbreviation")

# add into political data
dat <- merge(dat, politics, by.x='state','state_abb', all.x = TRUE)

# add column to indicate whether state was closed on that day 
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(closed = date >= StateClosureStartDate) %>% # add column "closed" to dat based on whether it is closed that day
  arrange(desc(date))
